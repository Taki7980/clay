# 23BG Web Development Assignment: Clay.com Clone

## Objective

The goal of this assignment is to create a clone of [Clay.com](https://www.clay.com) with a personalized touch for **23BG** using **Next.js** and **TailwindCSS**. You will work on cloning any **one page** from the site, ensuring it is fully **responsive**.

## Steps to Complete the Assignment

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Start by forking the web-dev repository from 23BG.

2. **Create a New Branch:**
   - Create a branch named after **your name** in the forked repository.  
   - Example: If your name is "John Doe," create a branch called `john-doe`.

3. **Set Up the Project:**
   - Set up a **Next.js** project and install **TailwindCSS** for styling.
   - You will clone **one page** from Clay.com and ensure that the page:
     - Uses **Next.js** for routing and page structure.
     - Utilizes **TailwindCSS** for responsive and clean design.
     - Reflects the **23BG** brand (colors, logos, or any other changes you find relevant).
   
4. **Make It Responsive:**
   - Ensure that the page works seamlessly across different screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

5. **Push Your Code:**
   - Push your code to the branch you created.
   - **Do not make a merge request**â€”the project should stay on your branch.

6. **Deploy the Project:**
   - Host the cloned page live (using any platform such as Vercel, Netlify, etc.).
   - Share the live link with me.

7. **Notify Me:**
   - Once your work is done, notify me via:
     - **Wellfound (AngelList)** OR
     - **Email**: iamprathameshmore07@gmail.com

## What We Are Looking For:
- Proficiency in **Next.js** routing.
- Correct use of **TailwindCSS** for clean, responsive design.
- Attention to detail in cloning the page while branding it as **23BG**.
- Efficient code structure and best practices.

## Additional Information

This is a test of your **design** and **development** skills, along with your ability to adapt a project to fit the **23BG** brand. Focus on quality, responsiveness, and branding.

We look forward to seeing your work!
